# BS-Envelope-Material-Stock-Estimation
This repository provides a comprehensive set of Python scripts and deep learning models for the segmentation and classification of building envelope (roof and façade) elements. It features roof material and type segmentation developed using Roboflow and Ultralytics libraries. Alongside façade classification models built with PyTorch and backbone architectures. In addition to the model implementations, the repository includes detailed calculations and summaries related to material stock and intensity for both  roofs and façades of the Area of Interest, Southport-North of the city of Gold Coast. All relevant code and documentation are available for reuse and adaptation to support further research or application in related domains.
